Name of QuantLet: STFloss04

Published in: Statistical Tools for Finance and Insurance

Description: 'Plots three sample gamma pdfs, Gamma(alpha, beta), on linear and Semi-logarithmic scales. Note, that the first one (black solid line) is an exponential law, while the last one (dashed blue line) is a chi-square distribution with nu=6 degrees of freedom. It also plots three sample log-normal pdfs, LogN(mu,sigma), on linear and semi-logarithmic plots. For small sigma the log-normal distribution resembles the Gaussian.'

Keywords: loss function, gamma, pdf, chi-square, lognormal, graphical representation, visualization
