Name of QuantLet: STFloss03

Published in: Statistical Tools for Finance and Insurance

Description: 'Plots a probability density function (pdf) of a mixture of two exponential distributions with mixing parameter a = 0.5 superimposed on the pdfs of the component distributions as well as semi-logarithmic plots. In the semi-logarithmic plot, the exponential pdfs are straight lines with slopes -beta. Note, the curvature of the pdf of the mixture if two exponentials. Requires mixexppdf.m to run the program (see quantnet).'

Keywords: loss function, exponential, approximation, pdf, lognormal, graphical representation, visualization
