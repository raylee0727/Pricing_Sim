Published in: Statistical Tools for Finance and Insurance

Description: 'Plots three sample Burr pdfs, Burr(alpha, lambda, tau), on linear and double-logarithmic scales and three sample Weibull pdfs, Weib(beta, tau), on a linear and semi-logarithmic scales. We can see that for tau<1 the tails are much heavier and they look like power-law. Requires Burrpdf.m to run the program (see quantnet).'

Keywords: loss function, weibull, pdf, graphical representation, visualization
